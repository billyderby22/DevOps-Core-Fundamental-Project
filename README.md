# DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project

## Project Brief
 To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

## Idea
i want to create an application that can create football teams and add players to them. I also want to be able to delete players and teams and be able to update players and teams. I would also like to be able to view the players and teams. Below is the ERD for my project.

In the future I would like to add more fields to my tables and also add a table for football managers and be able to add them to the teams. See ERD below.
